# **Attention for Music**  

This repository contains the implementation of the paper:  

**[Attention-guided Spectrogram Sequence Modeling with CNNs for Music Genre Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14474)**  

## **Overview**  
This project explores a novel approach to **music genre classification** using **attention-guided spectrogram sequence modeling** with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. By leveraging attention mechanisms, the model effectively identifies key temporal and frequency-based features in spectrograms, improving classification accuracy and interpretability.
